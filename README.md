For this project I used "React + Vite"'s template and tailwind's CSS library for alot of the styling. 

If you want to make something similar to this, use "npm create vite", select react, and javascript. 
I have a Notion page with my well documented experience with making this project, if you run into any issues hopefully I addressed some of them in the notes. 

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

TODO:
Whole'lotta icons:
- Add socials
- Add technologies
- Add certifications

Readability Buff
- Figure out mouse tracking
- fade out the background where the mouse is
(Should be implemented on the page level)
- Backdrop Blur
(saw a video on it)

BUGS:
- Mobile Support
- This means making my website responsive.
  ** This issue was supposed to be solved with Version (1) and is a known bug since Version (0). I tried addressing it using tailwind but I have not been able to properly test the website on such environments. That would be a good first start to hopefully finish this issue. 

 
Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
