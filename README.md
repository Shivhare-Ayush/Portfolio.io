For this project I used "React + Vite"'s template and tailwind's CSS library for alot of the styling. 

If you want to make something similar to this, use "npm create vite", select react, and javascript. 
I have a Notion page with my well documented experience with making this project, if you run into any issues hopefully I addressed some of them in the notes. 


Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
